# stateful-llm-builder

An experimental, state-driven LLM software agent that incrementally builds a frontend application
using a local Ollama model.

## What this project demonstrates

- Stateful, step-by-step code generation
- LLM-controlled but Python-governed workflow
- File-based progress tracking (`progress.json`)
- Safe parsing and controlled file writes
- Local Ollama integration (qwen3-coder)

This repository is intended for experimentation and learning, not production use.
